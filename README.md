# chip8-emulator
your average emulator using c++ and sdl2.0

tried to make it as simple as possible.
interpreter is done. recompiler is in the works

-auto frameskip
-upto 3.5mhz(3500000hz) in 60fps for intel 5th gen 3.1ghz cpu(msvc2013)

-this code requires sdl2 and sdl2_mixer to compile(check your include locations.. its on SDL2/SDL.h and SDL2/SDL_Mixer.h)

also im still fixing it so dont bother asking why some games wont work!
