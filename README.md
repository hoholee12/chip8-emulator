# chip8-emulator
your average emulator using c++ and sdl2.0

tried to make it as simple as possible.
interpreter is done. recompiler is in the works

-auto frameskip

-upto 3.5mhz(3500000hz) in 60fps for intel 5th gen 3.1ghz cpu(msvc2013)

-this code requires sdl2 and sdl2_mixer to compile(look into defaults.h if you encounter location problems)

-you also need data/sound/klik.wav in same directory format for sound.

also im still fixing it so dont bother asking why some games wont work!
